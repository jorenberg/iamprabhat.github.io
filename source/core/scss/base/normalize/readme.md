## Normalize.scss
A collection of HTML element and attribute style-normalizations, in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/): Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets.

Normalize.scss makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing — a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset.

## What does it do?
- Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.
- Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.
- Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
- Improves usability with subtle modifications.
- Explains what code does using detailed comments.

## How to use it?
Normalize.scss is a Sass Partial — A partial is a file that contains some of the Sass Code, that is used to organize our code. You have to just import through `@import` — directive.<br/>
```{css}
@import 'normalize';
```
<b>Note:</b> It's designed and coded by the help of many useful - `@function` & `@mixin` — directive.
